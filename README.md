# Minecraft Image to Map DataPack
This is a project for auto load maps into world created by third-party software which is used to turn images into Minecraft maps.  

however, it can only put already generated maps into world. But good news is that you don't need to place each map one by one into world.

这是一个将由第三方软件生成的地图画放入游戏地图中的数据包，

但是，这个数据包不能下载图片或者转换图片(受数据包限制); 但是它可以实现将转换好的地图画简单地加载进世界，而不用手动按编号一张张地摆放。
可以使用这个图片到地图转换器: https://github.com/tryashtar/image-map
